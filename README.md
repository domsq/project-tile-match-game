# Floral Memory Game

Floral Memory Game is all about finding the matching pairs of tiles within a limited number of tries. Users will click on a tile to reveal it, note what image has been shown, then try to locate the matching tile. It is aimed at users who are looking to test their memory, those looking for a simple game to help them relax, possibly as part of a mindfulness activity, or users who just want a fun distraction to pass the time. It will have relaxing imagery such as a welcoming landing page image and also flowers on the face side of the tiles.
