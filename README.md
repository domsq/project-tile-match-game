# Floral Match

The aim of Floral Match is to find the matching pairs of tiles within as few tries as possible. Users will click on a tile to reveal it, note what image has been shown, then try to locate the matching tile. It is aimed at users who are looking to test their memory, those looking for a simple game to help them relax, possibly as part of a mindfulness activity, or users who just want a fun distraction to pass the time. It will have relaxing imagery such as a welcoming landing page image and also flowers on the face side of the tiles. 

## UX

### Imagery

For my website, I went with a natural theme centred around greenery and flowers to promote the idea that playing the game could be used as part of a relaxation or mindfulness exercise. The landing page has a background image of a field of flowers and on the game page, the tile face sides are all flower images. The background image to the game page is a simple image of a wall of leaves.

### Typography

The fonts used for my website are "Chicle" for headings and "Lato" for the remaining body and button text. These fonts are provided by Google Fonts.

### Colour scheme
 
The fall back colour for the background images on the landing and game pages, should they not load correctly, is "darkslategray", which is a dark green \ blue colour. The colour used for the buttons is #5B5B5B, which is a medium grey colour. "Darkslategray" has also been used for the background colour to the heading on the landing page. The footer background colour is #E4E1D0, which is a pale sandy colour. The font colour is "whitesmoke".
